Cleans and formats the data in the network to a flat file format.

This will take the information from the database, clean/normalize it, and then
format it into a flat file that can be more easily used.  It will check if the
output already exists, get the network data from the mysql database,
clean/normalize the data, reformat it to the output format, and then write that
to the output location.

Arguments:
	edge_type (str): Limits edge types that are retrieved.
	species (str): The species to create output files for.
	edge_threshold (float): Limits edges based on weight.
	mysql host, user, port, password (?): The mysql server to connect to.
	normalization/cleaning method (str): Specifies how to normalize or clean the data.
	output format (str): Specifies the output format.
	output location (str): Directory to put the resulting files.

Output:
	Meta File: .../edge_type.species/cleaned_meta_file?
		number of genes
		number of properties
		number of edges
		degree distribution
		score distribution
		unmapped stats
		list of all genes
